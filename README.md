The goal of CaviR is to make it easy to get a nice output of R codes
without coding too many detailed information. At the moment, there are
the following functions:

- `coRtable` generates a correlation table with descriptive statistics
  and significance stars  
- `lm.diagnostics` generates a visual overview of linear model
  diagnostics
