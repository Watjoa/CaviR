The goal of CaviR is to make it easy to get a nice output of R codes without coding too many detailed information. At the moment, there are the following functions:

- `coRtable` generates a correlation table with descriptive statistics and significance stars  
- `lm.diagnostics` generates a visual overview of linear model diagnostics
